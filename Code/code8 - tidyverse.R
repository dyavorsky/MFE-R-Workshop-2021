## PRACTICE QUESTIONS
    
    # use the flights data to answer these questions
    install.packages("nycflights13")
    data(flights, package="nycflights13")
    
    #1. Convert the flights data.frame to a tibble.
    
    #2. What is the average airtime per destination?
    
    #3. Calculate the monthly average departure delay and arrival delay by NY airport ("origin")
    
    #4. Add the variable "tdf" to the data.table, where "tdf" is the total number of daily flights.
    #   That is, "tdf" is a count of the number of flights that departed each day
    #   As a check, Jan 1, 2013 had 842 flights that day (you should get the same number for Jan 1)
    
    #5. Delete the variable time_hour from the data.table
